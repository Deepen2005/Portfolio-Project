# Portfolio Part 1: Component Brainstorming

- **Name**: Deepen Chhetri
- **Dot Number**: Chhetri.30
- **Due Date**: 9/19 @ 4:10 pm

## Assignment Overview

The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Checklist

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

Below is further rationale/explanation for the rubric items above:

1. Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

I am interested in Network Management, Cybersecurity, and IT in general. I am CCNA certified and have completed network adminstration internships in the past, so this field is very interesting to me. In the future, my goal is to become a cybersecurity engineer or network adminstrator. I have worked in the transportation industry, so the blend of technology and transportation is also interesting to me. I worked at COTA, so it was interesting to see how applications like the Transit App helps operate the company. Futhermore, I was surprised to see how every bus had internet connectivity via a router, switch, and access point. Working in the transportaion industry has provided me with an insight into the field, so one of my goals is to explore how technology could further reform the industry. Besides technology, I also enjoy hanging out with friends, watching soccer games, and playing video games. My favorite soccer team is Liverpool and Barcelona currently. I enjoy playing Fortnite and FC 25/26.

## Assignment

As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided [some example components][example-components]
that may help you in your brainstorming. All of these components were made at
some point by one of your peers, so you should feel confident that you can
accomplish any of them.

There is no requirement that you use any of the components listed above.
If you want to model something else, go for it! Very common early object
projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

### Example Component

To help you brainstorm a few components, we've provided an example below of a
component you already know well: NaturalNumber. We highly recommend that you
mirror the formatting as close as possible in your designs. By following this
format, we can be more confident that your designs will be possible.

- Example Component: `NaturalNumber`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a non-negative
      integer. Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that
      provides the minimum functionality needed to represent a natural number.
      Then, we provide more complex mathematical operations in the secondary
      interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void multiplyBy10(int k)`: multiplies `this` by 10 and adds `k`
    - `int divideBy10()`: divides `this` by 10 and reports the remainder
    - `boolean isZero()`: reports whether `this` is zero
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void add(NaturalNumber n)`: adds `n` to `this`
    - `void subtract(NaturalNumber n)`: subtracts `n` from `this`
    - `void multiply(NaturalNumber n)`: multiplies `this` by `n`
    - `NaturalNumber divide(NaturalNumber n)`: divides `this` by `n`, returning
      the remainder
    - ...
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, basically all OSU components have to be mutable as long as they
        inherit from Standard. `clear`, `newInstance`, and `transferFrom` all
        mutate `this`.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No. All methods work with integers or other NaturalNumbers.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. NaturalNumber is base 10, and we track that in a constant called
          `RADIX`.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. The kernel methods `multiplyBy10` and `divideBy10` can be used to
        manipulate our natural number as needed. For example, to implement
        `increment`, we can trim the last digit off with `divideBy10`, add 1 to
        it, verify that the digit hasn't overflown, and multiply the digit back.
        If the digit overflows, we reset it to zero and recursively call
        `increment`.

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for manipulating a digit at a time in the number. The secondary
methods use these manipulations to perform more complex operations like
adding two numbers together.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `NaturalNumber1L` class which layers the
kernel on top of the existing `BigInteger` class in Java. It would also be
reasonable to implement `NaturalNumber2` on top of `String` as seen in
Project 2. Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

- Component Design #1: Binary Conversion
  - **Description**:
    - This component helps model a non-negative integer in binary form. The kernel provides simple operations in base 2 while the secondary methods are useful to convert to string and back to decimal. In networking, this would help as network IPs and subnet masks are represented in binary form.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - void multiplyBy2(int bit): Multiplies this by 2 and adds bit binary. This requires bit to be 0 or 1.
    - int divideBy2(): Divides this by 2 and returns the least significant bit
    - boolean isZero(): checks if this equals 0
    - void clear(): resets this to value of 0
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - String toBinary(): Returns the binary representation of the integer in string
  -  int toDecimal (int num): Helps to convert IP Addresses to dotted-decimial representations (their actual form)
  - boolean equals(int decimal): compares current binary value with base-10 decimal number to see if they match
  **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, because the kernel methods will change this. Also, all OSU components have to be mutable if they inherit from Standard. Clear() is an example.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No, because this component relies on just manipulating numbers/digits.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, because we will be using constant RADIX = 2 to represent binary numbers.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, since String toBinary() can be implemented by using divideBy2() to get the bits (remainders) and rebuild it using multiplyBy2(remainder).

- Component Design #2: Portocol Numbers and Names
  - **Description**:
    - This component is created to model an Internet Protocol Number, which helps identify the portocol associated in the IP packet. Examples of this include TCP, UDP, HTTP. This component will help associate the numbers with the correct name of the protocol.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - void multiplyBy10(int n): Multiplies this by 10 and adds digit n
    - int divideBy10(): Divides this by 10 and returns the right digit (remainder).
    - boolean isZero(): Checks if the protocol number is 0
    -void clear(): resets this to 0
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - String name(): returns the name of the protocol including "unknown"
    - String toString(): helps convert protocol number to strng
    - boolean match(String protocolNum): checks if two protocol numbers are the same
    - boolean checkTransportLayer4(): Checks if the protocol is a UDP/TCP protocol
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, since the number (this) can be modified using methods like clear() and multiplyBy10().
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - I could take a different approach for this, but I am planning on using Map to make it easier to match the protocol numbers with their names like UDP, DNS, etc.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, since we can store common protocols like TCP and UDP as constants.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - For some things like matching protocol numbers we could implement it using divideBy10() constantly and comparing the digits.

- Component Design #3: Same Network Verification
  - **Description**:
    - This component helps check if two IP addresses belong to the same network. This is helpful for routing, subnetting, access control lists, etc in networking. The kernel methods hlep store the IP in digit form while secondary methods convert and checks the network.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - void set(String ip, String subnetMask): Pairs the ip and subnet mask in string format
    - void multiplyBy10(int n): Multiplies this by 10 and adds digit
    - int divideBy10(): Divides this by 10 and returns the remainder
    - boolean isZero(): checks if the network does not exist
    - void clear(): resets this network to empty or 0
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - boolean isSameNetwork (String IP, String subnetMask): Checks to see if two IP Addresses are part of the same network
  - String toString (): Helps to convert IP  Addresses to dotted-decimial representations (their actual form)
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. Kernel methods like clear modify the IP and subnet mask by resetting this to 0.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - I might use Map to match each IP with the correct subnet mask, so it easier to compare two IP addresses.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I may use constants like maxOctet = 255 to show that the max number in the octet is 255.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. For example, toString() could be rebuild by calling divideBy10() and getting the digits consantly and then rebuilding it using multiplyBy10().

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

Concept Brainstorming: 9/21/2025

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Since this is likely the first time you've done this, we would recommend
browsing the existing file. It includes all of the changes made to the portfolio
project template. When you're ready, you should delete this file and start your
own. Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## YYYY.MM.DD

### Added

- Designed a Binary Conversion component
- Designed a Portocol Numbers and Names component
- Designed a Same Network Verification component
```

Here `2025.09.21` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting. For future assignments, you will
just be submitting a link to a pull request. This will be the only time
you have to submit any PDFs.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
